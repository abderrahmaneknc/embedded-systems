Embedded Systems Projects

This repository contains embedded systems projects developed and tested using SimulIDE and PlatformIO inside Visual Studio Code.

🛠️ Tools & Environment

Visual Studio Code

PlatformIO (for development, build, and HEX generation)

SimulIDE (for circuit simulation)

⚙️ How the Projects Are Used

Each project is developed and compiled using PlatformIO in VS Code.

The build process generates a .hex file.

This HEX file is loaded into the microcontroller inside SimulIDE.

The circuit is then simulated and tested within SimulIDE.

⚠️ The simulation relies on loading the generated HEX file into the corresponding microcontroller component in SimulIDE.

📄 Reports

Each project in this repository is accompanied by a PDF report.

The report explains:

Project objectives

Simulation setup

Results and observations

You can find the PDF report inside each project folder.


✅ Notes

All simulations were validated using SimulIDE.

All firmware was built using PlatformIO.

This repository is intended for educational and academic purposes.
